### Usage

| Button type     | Purpose                                                                          |
| --------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary         | Use for main CTA's. Examples: Sign-up, Get Started.                                 |
| Secondary       | Use for less critical actions. Examples: Next, Save, Cancel.                |
| Disabled        | Use when the user cannot proceed until an input is collected.     |
| Buttons on a dark background | XXX.                    |
| Big Button    | Use to bring attention to a CTA. Only use 1 big button on a page. Example: You can use a big button on a hero image     |

### Best Practices

  - Aim to only use 1-2 buttons per page. Too many calls to action can cause confusion and make users unsure of what to do next.
  - If you need to use multiple buttons, avoid using more than one yellow button on a page or placing 2 buttons side by side unless they are in contained cards.
  - Use established button colors appropriately. For example, stick to using a yellow button for the Sign-up action.

### Content guidelines
  - <i class="material-icons">done</i> Use sentence case for button labels.
  - <i class="material-icons">done</i> Button labels should be descriptive and predictable. Also, make the first word of the button's label a verb. Examples: View all videos, Load more videos, Download videos
  - <i class="material-icons">close</i> Do not use labels that don't provide any context. Examples: Videos, Load more, Download

### When to use something else
* • Use the link component if you want to include an action in a line of text. Example: View our plans & pricing to signup for a plan and get started today.
