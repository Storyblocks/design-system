### Usage

| Button type     | Purpose                                                                          |
| --------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary         | Use for main CTA's. Examples: Sign-up, Get Started.                                 |
| Secondary       | Use for less critical actions. Examples: Next, Save, Cancel.                |
| Disabled        | Use when the user cannot proceed until an input is collected. The button should become a primary or secondary button after the required input is collected.     |
| Buttons on a dark background | XXX.                    |
| Big Button    | Use to bring more attention to a CTA and only use 1 big button on a page. Examples: a CTA on hero-images      |

### Best Practices

* Aim to only use 1-2 buttons per page. Too many calls to action can cause confusion and make users unsure of what to do next.
* If you need to use multiple buttons, avoid using more than one yellow button on a page or placing 2 buttons side by side unless they are in contained cards.
* Use established button colors appropriately. For example, stick to using a yellow button for the Sign-up action. 


### Content guidelines
Button labels should be descriptive and predictable. Also, make the first word of the button's label a verb. Examples:

<i class="material-icons">done</i> View all videos
<i class="material-icons">done</i> Load more videos
<i class="material-icons">done</i> Download videos

Use sentence case for button labels.

### When to use something else
* • Use the link component if you want to include an action in a line of text. Example: View our plans & pricing to signup for a plan and get started today.
