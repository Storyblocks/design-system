### Usage

| Button type     | Purpose                                                                          |
| --------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary         | For the principle call to action on the page.                                    |
| Secondary       | When an action does not require primary dominance on the page.                   |
| Danger          | When an action has harmful intentions to the users data (delete, remove, etc).   |
| Disabled button | Use when the user cannot proceed until an input is collected.                    |
| Small Button    | Use when there is not enough vertical space for a regular sized button.          |
