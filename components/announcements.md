### Best practices
#### New feature announcements should:
* Always be dismissible. Once dismissed, they should never be shown again.
* Use the pointer arrow to point to the new feature, whenever possible. The arrow can appear on the left, right, top, or bottom of the box but should always be centered.
#### New feature announcements should not:
* Use any photos or images, only simple illustrations are acceptable.
* Use headlines (H1, H2, etc.). However, you can bold the copy that explains the new feature. 
#### Visual requirements:
* The box background color should always be Storyblocks Blue.
* Always include the NEW FEATURE tag directly above the text.
* The NEW FEATURE tag background color should always be white with black text.

### Content guidelines
* Be concise and scannable — users shouldn’t need to spend a lot of time figuring out what the feature is and how to use it.
* The max character length is 1024 characters.
