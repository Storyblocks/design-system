Good user experience is in our design DNA. We always start with user needs in mind to gain a clear understanding of their motives and goals. This allows us to focus on creating solutions that are functional, visually pleasing, and add value. Below are the core principles that guide our design process.


## Content-First
Delivering great content is at the heart of what Storyblocks does. Our visual style is clean and minimal so that our content stands out and isnâ€™t overshadowed by unnecessary design elements.

## Consistent
We use consistent design patterns, language, and tone to familiarize people with our product which builds trust.

## Intentional
Our design choices are deliberate and provide clear paths that enable users to complete tasks quickly and easily.
